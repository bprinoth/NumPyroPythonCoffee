# NumPyro Python Coffee

I recommend though that you generate a new python environment, e.g. through conda with python 3.10.11 (which is the version I used), from your terminal.

```conda create --name pycoffee python=3.10```

```conda activate pycoffee ```

Then you can install the requirement files using:

```!python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt ```
